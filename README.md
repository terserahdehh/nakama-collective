To implement the checklists required for the assignment, first I created a folder and named it based on the shop I want to make, nakama-collective. Next I opened the directory through Virtual Studio Code and opened the terminal to create a virtual environment using the python -m venv env command. Then I activate that virtual environment with the env\Scripts\activate command. After that, I created a file named requirements.txt inside the same directory.
